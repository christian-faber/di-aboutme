        <p class="card-content">
          Cooking is a way to break away from everything else! My foods are
          typically salty, spicy, or a mix. I don't bake much (that involves too
          much waiting). One of my love languages is making people dinner!
          Eating food is by far my favorite part though!

        <p class="card-content">
          I enjoy traveling, but a bit more in-depth than typical sight seeing
          (while I have done a fair share of this). I enjoy experiencing and
          learning from new cultures; including learning language, etiquette,
          cuisine, and activities!

        <p class="card-content">
          Surfing is a newer passion of mine! Moving to Kaua ªi was my first
          long-term exposure to living near the ocean; and I LOVE it! I started
          learning how to swim with the waves, and realized I wanted to learn
          even more. A friend of mine suggested we learn together, and from July
          to January, I went every Saturday.

        <p class="card-content">
          I recently started a new business! The work I do currently involves
          data analysis, information tools, and collaborating and facilitating
          interest groups. The origin of the business creation was to satisfy an
          ability to work with an organization I previously worked with;
          however, this was the perfect launching pad to support community
          projects, work with local organizations, and pursue innovation!
